    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 loaf Italian bread</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 to 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut the bread into 1 inch slices without cutting all the way through the bottom crust. Place slices on a foil-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together melted butter and garlic. Spoon mixture evenly over bread, making sure it's getting in between the slices.</li>
        <li>Combine cheeses in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly between bread slices, again getting in between each slice.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until cheese is melted and bread is lightly toasted. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
